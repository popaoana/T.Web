				President Dwight D. Eisenhower established NASA in 1958 with a distinctly civilian, rather than military, 
			orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, 
			disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1,
			1958. Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab
			space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion 
			Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program
			which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.</font></p>

		<h2><font color="white"><em>Project Gemini (1961–1966)</em></font></h2>
		<p><font color="white">Based on studies to grow the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, 
			and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned
			lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3,
			was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly 
			fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.</font></p>

		<h2><font color="white"><em>Apollo program (1961–1972)</em></font></h2>
		<p><font color="white">The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John
		F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, 
		which effectively launched the Apollo program.It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects.
		The first person to stand on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, who was followed by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael Collins orbited above. Five subsequent Apollo 
		missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon. 
		These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms (842 lb) of lunar samples. Topics covered by experiments performed included 
		soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind. The Moon landing marked the end of the space race;
		and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon.</font></p>
